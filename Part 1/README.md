## Part 1 

* This part of the Computer Vision repo explores Open CV library by performing basic computer vision tasks like scaling, filtering, phase swapping, hybrid Image, Multi resolution blending using Gaussian and Laplacian Pyramids. 

* It also shows how Convolution can be implemented as Matrix multiplication by using Toeplitz matrix

* The report consists of all the code along with its explanation of implementation as comments

* The handsolved problems can be found at the end
